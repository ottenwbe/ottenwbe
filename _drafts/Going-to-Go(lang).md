Over the last couple of years I had the fortune (or misfortune) to implement various solutions with various programming languages. This experience ranges from system languages like C and C++, to scripting languages like Ruby and Python, to  GUI first languages like Delphi, to high level programming languages like Java. Most recently I started to switch to Go. In this post I summarize my experience and impressions about the language's strength and weaknesses. 


## Learning curve ##

What struck me first was how fast I had my first small applications up and running. I was especially impressed how easy it was to write a concurrent application with goroutines and channels. 

Of course, the C like Syntax helped in getting familiar with the language. But where I stumbled was the order of data type and parameter/variable name in function signatures/variable declarations. This is not a negative point, I agree with the reasoning given on the Go Blog https://blog.golang.org/gos-declaration-syntax that it improves the readability. Yet it shows the small hurdles in switching from C like languages. 

## Multiple return values ##

In the past I often faced the problem that I had to return multiple values from a function. At first this sounds like a small advantage in Go. I came to appreciate it very much. 

## Dependency Management ##
 
*go get and vendor is not sufficient 


## Pointer ##

*good to have them for control


## Opinionated structure ##

*irritating at first; helpful in the long run


## Garbage collection

*why gc in system language 

## Error handling

* helps overview

## Strong typization
