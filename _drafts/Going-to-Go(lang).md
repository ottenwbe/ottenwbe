Over the last couple of years I had the fortune (or misfortune) to implement various solutions with various programming languages. This ranges from system languages like C and C++, to scripting languages like Ruby and Python, to  GUI first languages like Delphi, to high level programming languages like Java. Most recently I started to switch to Go. In this post I summarize my experience and impressions about the language's strength and weaknesses. 


## Learning curve ##

What struck me first was how fast I had my first small applications up and running. I was especially impressed how easy it was to write a concurrent application with goroutines and channels. 

## Multiple return values ##

I often faced the problem that I had to return multiple values from a function. At first this sounds like a small advantage. 

## Dependency Management ##

## Pointer ##

## Opinionated structure ##

## Garage collection

## Error handling
